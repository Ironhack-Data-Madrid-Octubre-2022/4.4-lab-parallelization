HiSoft Systems - Wikipedia                                    HiSoft Systems  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search Software companies of the United Kingdom HiSoft SystemsIndustrysoftwareFounded1980FounderDavid LinkHeadquartersDunstable, BedfordshireProductsDevpac HiSoft Systems[1] is a software company based in the UK, creators of a range of programming tools for microcomputers in 1980s and 1990s. Their first products were Pascal and Assembler implementations for the NASCOM 1 and 2 kit-based computers, followed by Pascal and C for ZX Spectrum computers, as well as a BASIC compiler for this platform and a C compiler for CP/M. While compilers for the ZX Spectrum were typical products for this platform, with integrated editor, compiler and runtime environment fitting in RAM together with program's source, the C compiler for CP/M was typical for this operating system, batch operated, with separate compilation and linking stages.[citation needed] Their most well-known products were the Devpac assembler IDE environments (earlier known as GenST and GenAm for the Atari ST and Amiga, respectively). The Devpac IDE was a full editor/assembler/debugger environment written entirely in 68k assembler and was a favourite tool among programmers on the Atari GEM platform. HiSoft also sold HiSoft BASIC, HiSoft C Interpreter for the Atari ST, Aztec C, Personal Pascal and FTL Modula-2. The business was created in 1980 and was based in Dunstable, Bedfordshire before relocating to the village of Greenfield in the same county. In November 2001, HiSoft's staff were employed by Maxon Computer Limited, the UK arm of MAXON Computer GmbH.[2] to work on Cinema 4D.[citation needed] David Link, the founder and owner, ran a café ([3]) in the village of Emsworth for a year until July 2007 and a restaurant/bar/guest house([4]) in Shanklin, Isle of Wight, from 2010 until January 2015. HiSOFT continues, with David Link at the helm, and is now[when?] actively involved in designing websites and selling the Ambur POS system.[citation needed]  References[edit]   ^ http://www.hisoft.co.uk/about/about.htmlAbout Hisoft Archived 2011-10-29 at the Wayback Machine  ^ Maxon Computer GmbH, press release, November 8, 2001[dead link] Archived  ^ Emsworth Café  ^ The Waterfront Inn   External links[edit] HiSoft Systems World of Spectrum HiSoft archive Authority control  VIAF 1 WorldCat      Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HiSoft_Systems&oldid=1064765647" Categories: ZX SpectrumSoftware companies of the United KingdomAmigaAtari STSoftware companies established in 19801980 establishments in the United KingdomHidden categories: Webarchive template wayback linksAll articles with dead external linksArticles with dead external links from April 2019Articles with short descriptionShort description matches WikidataAll articles with unsourced statementsArticles with unsourced statements from January 2020Articles with unsourced statements from July 2020All articles with vague or ambiguous timeVague or ambiguous time from July 2020Articles with VIAF identifiersArticles with WORLDCATID identifiers    Navigation menu    Personal tools   Not logged inTalkContributionsCreate accountLog in      Namespaces   ArticleTalk      English          Views   ReadEditView history      More         Search                    Navigation   Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate     Contribute   HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload file     Tools   What links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPage informationCite this pageWikidata item     Print/export   Download as PDFPrintable version     Languages    Add links        This page was last edited on 10 January 2022, at 03:04 (UTC).
