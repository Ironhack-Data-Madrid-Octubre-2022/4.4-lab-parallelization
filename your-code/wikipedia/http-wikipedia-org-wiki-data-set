Data set - Wikipedia Data setFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchCollection of dataFor IBM mainframe term for a file, see Data set (IBM mainframe). For the telecommunications interface device, see Modem.A data set (or dataset) is a collection of data. In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more database tables, where every column of a table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given record of the data set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as for example height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set.  Data sets can also consist of a collection of documents or files.[1]In the open data discipline, data set is the unit to measure the information released in a public open data repository.  The European data.europa.eu portal aggregates more than a million data sets.[2]  Some other issues (real-time data sources,[3] non-relational data sets, etc.) increases the difficulty to reach a consensus about it.[3]Contents1 Properties2 Classic data sets3 See also4 References5 External linksProperties[edit]Several characteristics define a data set's structure and properties.  These include the number and types of the attributes or variables, and various statistical measures applicable to them, such as standard deviation and kurtosis.Jan M. Żytkow, Jan Rauch (2000). Principles of data mining and knowledge discovery. ISBN 978-3-540-66490-1.</ref>The values may be numbers, such as real numbers or integers, for example representing a person's height in centimeters, but may also be nominal data (i.e., not consisting of numerical values), for example representing a person's ethnicity. More generally, values may be of any of the kinds described as a level of measurement. For each variable, the values are normally all of the same kind. However, there may also be missing values, which must be indicated in some way.In statistics, data sets usually come from actual observations obtained by sampling a statistical population, and each row corresponds to the observations on one element of that population. Data sets may further be generated by algorithms for the purpose of testing certain kinds of software.  Some modern statistical analysis software such as SPSS still present their data in the classical data set fashion.  If data is missing or suspicious an imputation method may be used to complete a data set.[4]Classic data sets[edit]Several classic data sets have been used extensively in the statistical literature:Iris flower data set – Multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher (1936).[5]MNIST database – Images of handwritten digits commonly used to test classification, clustering, and image processing algorithmsCategorical data analysis – Data sets used in the book, An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis.Robust statistics – Data sets used in Robust Regression and Outlier Detection (Rousseeuw and Leroy, 1968).
