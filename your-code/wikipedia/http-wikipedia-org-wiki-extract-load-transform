(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Extract, load, transform (ELT) is an alternative to extract, transform, load (ETL) used with data lake implementations. In contrast to ETL, in ELT models the data is not transformed on entry to the data lake, but stored in its original raw format. This enables faster loading times. However, ELT requires sufficient processing power within the data processing engine to carry out the transformation on demand, to return the results in a timely manner. Since the data is not processed on entry to the data lake, the query and schema do not need to be defined a priori (although often the schema will be available during load since many data sources are extracts from databases or similar structured data systems and hence have an associated schema). ELT is a data pipeline model.[1]Contents1 Cloud data lake components1.1 Common storage options1.2 Querying2 References3 External linksCloud data lake components[edit]Common storage options[edit]AWSSimple Storage Service (S3)Amazon RDSAzureAzure Blob StorageGCPGoogle Storage (GCS)Querying[edit]AWSRedshift SpectrumAthenaEMR (Presto)AzureAzure Data LakeGCPBigQueryReferences[edit]^ Using Redshift Spectrum to load data pipelines Published by deductive.com on January 17, 2018, retrieved on April 3, 2019External links[edit]Dull, Tamara, "The Data Lake Debate: Pro is Up First", smartdatacollective.com, March 20, 2015.This computing article is a stub.
