Since it was now possible to store a discrete fact and quickly access it using random access disk technology, those suggesting that data management was more important than business process management used arguments such as "a customer's home address is stored in 75 (or some other large number) places in our computer systems."  However, during this period, random access processing was not competitively fast, so those suggesting "process management" was more important than "data management" used batch processing time as their primary argument. As application software evolved into real-time, interactive usage, it became obvious that both management processes were important.  If the data was not well defined, the data would be mis-used in applications. If the process wasn't well defined, it was impossible to meet user needs.

Thus data management has become information management or knowledge management. This trend obscures the raw data processing and renders interpretation implicit. The distinction between data and derived value is illustrated by the information ladder. However, data has staged a comeback with the popularisation of the term big data, which refers to the collection and analyses of massive sets of data. Several organisations have established data management centers (DMC) for their operations.[2] ``  See also[edit]  Open data FAIR data Pseudonymization Information architecture Enterprise architecture Information design Information system Controlled vocabulary Data curation Data retention Data management plan Data mesh, a domain-oriented data architecture[3] Computer data storage Data proliferation Digital preservation Document management Enterprise content management Hierarchical storage management Information repository Machine-readable documents Performance report System integration Customer data integration Identity management Identity theft Data theft ERP software CRM software  References[edit]   ^ Hoare, C.
