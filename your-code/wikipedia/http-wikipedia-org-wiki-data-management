Since it was now possible to store a discrete fact and quickly access it using random access disk technology, those suggesting that data management was more important than business process management used arguments such as "a customer's home address is stored in 75 (or some other large number) places in our computer systems."  However, during this period, random access processing was not competitively fast, so those suggesting "process management" was more important than "data management" used batch processing time as their primary argument. As application software evolved into real-time, interactive usage, it became obvious that both management processes were important.  If the data was not well defined, the data would be mis-used in applications. If the process wasn't well defined, it was impossible to meet user needs.Topics[edit]Topics in data management include:Data governanceData assetData governanceData trusteeData custodian or guardianData stewardData subjectData ethicsData architectureData architectureDataflowsData modeling and designDatabase and storage managementData maintenanceDatabase administrationDatabase management systemBusiness continuity planningHierarchical storage managementData subsettingData securityData accessData erasureData privacyData securityReference and master dataData integrationMaster data managementReference dataData Integration and inter-operabilityData movement (ETL, ELT)Data interoperabilityDocuments and contentDocument management systemRecords managementData warehousing and business intelligence and AnalyticsBusiness intelligenceData analysis and data miningData warehouse and data martData analyticsMetadataMetadata managementMetadataMetadata discoveryMetadata publishingMetadata registryData qualityData discoveryData cleansingData integrityData enrichmentData qualityData quality assuranceSecondary dataUsage[edit]Part of a series onLibrary and information scienceOutlineGlossaryHistoriesLibraries - InformationFocusArchives management - Collections management (Preservation) - Data management - Information management (cataloguing) - Knowledge management - Library managementCurationData - Metadata - Information - Documents - Artefacts - KnowledgeInterdisciplinary fieldsArchival science - Communication studies - Computer science - Data science - Documentation science - Epistemology - Library science - Information science - Science and technology studiesAreasAcademic - Archival - Legal - Health - Private - Public - School - SpecialWikiProject CategoryvteIn modern management usage, the term data is increasingly replaced by information or even knowledge in a non-technical context. Thus data management has become information management or knowledge management. This trend obscures the raw data processing and renders interpretation implicit. The distinction between data and derived value is illustrated by the information ladder.However, data has staged a comeback with the popularisation of the term big data, which refers to the collection and analyses of massive sets of data.Several organisations have established data management centers (DMC) for their operations.[2]``See also[edit]Open dataFAIR dataPseudonymizationInformation architectureEnterprise architectureInformation designInformation systemControlled vocabularyData curationData retentionData management planData mesh, a domain-oriented data architecture[3]Computer data storageData proliferationDigital preservationDocument managementEnterprise content managementHierarchical storage managementInformation repositoryMachine-readable documentsPerformance reportSystem integrationCustomer data integrationIdentity managementIdentity theftData theftERP softwareCRM softwareReferences[edit]^ Hoare, C.
