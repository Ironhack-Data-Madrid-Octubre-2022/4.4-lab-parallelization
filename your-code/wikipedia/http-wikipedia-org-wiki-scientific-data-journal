The journal was not the first to publish data papers, but is one of a few journals whose content consists primarily of data papers.[3][4] The journal is abstracted and indexed by Index Medicus/MEDLINE/PubMed.[5]  References[edit]   ^ Jump, Paul (2013), Nature's publishers to launch open-access platform for data sets and analysis of public data sets, Times Higher Education, retrieved 2015-06-11  ^ "FAQ | Scientific Data". www.nature.com.
