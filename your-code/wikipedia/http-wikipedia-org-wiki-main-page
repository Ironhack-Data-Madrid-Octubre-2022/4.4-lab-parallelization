To transform Port Moresby into a major base, engineers built airfields, wharves, roads, and warehouses. The interior was covered with dense rainforest and rugged mountains that wheeled vehicles could not traverse. Few aircraft were available, and they were restricted by the weather and subject to destruction on the ground by Japanese air raids. The loss of the airstrip at Kokoda led to the adoption of airdropping (pictured). Due to a shortage of parachutes, supplies were often dropped without them, with attendant losses and breakages. Trucks, jeeps, and pack animals carried stores, ammunition, and rations only part of the way. The rest of the journey over the Kokoda Track was on the backs of Papuan carriers, who struggled over the mountains lugging heavy loads. They often carried the wounded too, which earned them the sobriquet of "Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels". (Full article...)   Recently featured:  1963–64 Gillingham F.C. season J.

Waxman presents oral arguments before the US Supreme Court in the case Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt, a United States Supreme Court case that determined that unless they consent, states have sovereign immunity from private suits filed against them in the courts of another state.  The 5–4 decision overturned precedent set in a 1979 Supreme Court case, Nevada v. Hall.  This was the third time that the litigants had presented their case to the Court, as the Court had already ruled on the issue in 2003 and 2016.
