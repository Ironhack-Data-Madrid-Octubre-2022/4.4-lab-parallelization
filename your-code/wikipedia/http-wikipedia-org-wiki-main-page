Trucks, jeeps, and pack animals carried stores, ammunition, and rations only part of the way.

Waxman presents oral arguments before the US Supreme Court in the case Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt, a United States Supreme Court case that determined that unless they consent, states have sovereign immunity from private suits filed against them in the courts of another state.
