Data sonification - Wikipedia                                   Data sonification  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    Jump to navigation Jump to search Data sonification is the presentation of data as sound using sonification. It is the auditory equivalent of the more established practice of data visualization. The usual process for data sonification is directing digital media of a dataset through a software synthesizer and into a digital-to-analog converter to produce sound for humans to experience.[1] Applications of data sonification include astronomy studies of star creation,[2] interpreting cluster analysis,[3] and geoscience.[4] Various projects describe the production of sonifications as a collaboration between scientists and musicians.[5] A target demographic for using data sonification is the blind community because of the inaccessibility of data visualizations.[6]  References[edit]   ^ Kaper, H.G.; Wiebel, E.; Tipei, S.
