The phonograph cylinder is a storage medium. The phonograph may be considered a storage device especially as machines of this vintage were able to record on blank cylinders. On a reel-to-reel tape recorder (Sony TC-630), the recorder is data storage equipment and the magnetic tape is a data storage medium.Computer memory and data storage typesGeneralMemory cellMemory coherenceCache coherenceMemory hierarchyMemory access patternMemory mapSecondary storageMOS memoryfloating-gateContinuous availabilityAreal density (computer storage)Block (data storage)Object storageDirect-attached storageNetwork-attached storageStorage area networkBlock-level storageSingle-instance storageDataStructured dataUnstructured dataBig dataMetadataData compressionData corruptionData cleansingData degradationData integrityData securityData validationData validation and reconciliationData recoveryStorageData clusterDirectoryShared resourceFile sharingFile systemClustered file systemDistributed file systemDistributed file system for cloudDistributed data storeDistributed databaseDatabaseData bankData storageData storeData deduplicationData structureData redundancyReplication (computing)Memory refreshStorage recordInformation repositoryKnowledge baseComputer fileObject fileFile deletionFile copyingBackupCore dumpHex dumpData communicationInformation transferTemporary fileCopy protectionDigital rights managementVolume (computing)Boot sectorMaster boot recordVolume boot recordDisk arrayDisk imageDisk mirroringDisk aggregationDisk partitioningMemory segmentationLocality of referenceLogical diskStorage virtualizationVirtual memoryMemory-mapped fileSoftware entropySoftware rotIn-memory databaseIn-memory processingPersistence (computer science)Persistent data structureRAIDNon-RAID drive architecturesMemory pagingBank switchingGrid computingCloud computingCloud storageFog computingEdge computingDew computingAmdahl's lawMoore's lawKryder's lawVolatileRAMHardware cacheCPU cacheScratchpad memoryDRAMeDRAMSDRAMSGRAMLPDDRQDRSRAMEDO DRAMXDR DRAMRDRAMSDRAMDDRGDDRHBMSRAM1T-SRAMReRAMQRAMContent-addressable memory (CAM)VRAMDual-ported RAMVideo RAM (dual-ported DRAM)HistoricalWilliams–Kilburn tube (1946–1947)Delay-line memory (1947)Mellon optical memory (1951)Selectron tube (1952)DekatronT-RAM (2009)Z-RAM (2002–2010)Non-volatileROMMROMPROMEPROMEEPROMROM cartridgeSolid-state storage (SSS)Flash memory is used in:Solid-state drive (SSD)Solid-state hybrid drive (SSHD)USB flash driveIBM FlashSystemFlash Core ModuleMemory cardMemory StickCompactFlashPC CardMultiMediaCardSD cardSIM cardSmartMediaUniversal Flash StorageSxSMicroP2XQD cardProgrammable metallization cellNVRAMMemistorMemristorPCM (3D XPoint)MRAMElectrochemical RAM (ECRAM)Nano-RAMCBRAMEarly-stage NVRAMFeRAMReRAMFeFET memoryAnalog recordingPhonograph cylinderPhonograph recordQuadruplex videotapeVision Electronic Recording ApparatusMagnetic recordingMagnetic storageMagnetic tapeMagnetic-tape data storageTape driveTape libraryDigital Data Storage (DDS)VideotapeVideocassetteCassette tapeLinear Tape-OpenBetamax8 mm video formatDVMiniDVMicroMVU-maticVHSS-VHSVHS-CD-VHSHard disk driveOptical3D optical data storageOptical discLaserDiscCompact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA)CDCD VideoCD-RCD-RWVideo CDSuper Video CDMini CDNintendo optical discsCD-ROMHyper CD-ROMDVDDVD+RDVD-VideoDVD cardDVD-RAMMiniDVDHD DVDBlu-rayUltra HD Blu-rayHolographic Versatile DiscWORMIn developmentCBRAMRacetrack memoryNRAMMillipede memoryECRAMPatterned mediaHolographic data storageElectronic quantum holography5D optical data storageDNA digital data storageUniversal memoryTime crystalQuantum memoryUltraRAMHistoricalPaper data storage (1725)Punched card (1725)Punched tape (1725)PlugboardDelay-line memoryDrum memory (1932)Magnetic-core memory (1949)Plated-wire memory (1957)Core rope memory (1960s)Thin-film memory (1962)Disk pack (1962)Twistor memory (~1968)Bubble memory (~1970)Floppy disk (1971)vteData storage is the recording (storing) of information (data) in a storage medium. Handwriting, phonographic recording, magnetic tape, and optical discs are all examples of storage media. Biological molecules such as RNA and DNA are considered by some as data storage.[1][2] Recording may be accomplished with virtually any form of energy. Electronic data storage requires electrical power to store and retrieve data. Data storage in a digital, machine-readable medium is sometimes called digital data. Computer data storage is one of the core functions of a general-purpose computer. Electronic documents can be stored in much less space than paper documents.[3] Barcodes and magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) are two ways of recording machine-readable data on paper.Contents1 Recording media2 Global capacity, digitization, and trends3 See also4 References5 Further readingRecording media[edit]A recording medium is a physical material that holds information. Newly created information is distributed and can be stored in four storage media–print, film, magnetic, and optical–and seen or heard in four information flows–telephone, radio and TV, and the Internet[4] as well as being observed directly.  Digital information is stored on electronic media in many different recording formats.With electronic media, the data and the recording media are sometimes referred to as "software" despite the more common use of the word to describe computer software. With (traditional art) static media, art materials such as crayons may be considered both equipment and medium as the wax, charcoal or chalk material from the equipment becomes part of the surface of the medium.Some recording media may be temporary either by design or by nature. Volatile organic compounds may be used to preserve the environment or to purposely make data expire over time.  Data such as smoke signals or skywriting are temporary by nature. Depending on the volatility, a gas (e.g. atmosphere, smoke) or a liquid surface such as a lake would be considered a temporary recording medium if at all.Global capacity, digitization, and trends[edit]A 2003 UC Berkeley report estimated that about five exabytes of new information were produced in 2002 and that 92% of this data was stored on hard disk drives. This was about twice the data produced in 2000. [5] The amount of data transmitted over telecommunication systems in 2002 was nearly 18 exabytes—three and a half times more than was recorded on non-volatile storage. Telephone calls constituted 98% of the telecommunicated information in 2002. The researchers' highest estimate for the growth rate of newly stored information (uncompressed) was more than 30% per year.A 2011 Science (journal) article estimated that the year 2002 was the beginning of the digital age for information storage: an age in which more information is stored on digital storage devices than on analog storage devices.[6] In 1986, approximately 1% of the world's capacity to store information was in digital format; this grew to 3% by 1993, to 25% by 2000, and to 97% by 2007. These figures correspond to less than three compressed exabytes in 1986, and 295 compressed exabytes in 2007.[6] The quantity of digital storage doubled roughly every three years.[7]In a more limited study, the International Data Corporation estimated that the total amount of digital data in 2007 was 281 exabytes, and that the total amount of digital data produced exceeded the global storage capacity for the first time.[8]See also[edit]Archival scienceBlank media taxComputer data storageComputer memoryContent formatData retentionData transmissionDigital dark ageDigital preservationDigital RevolutionDisk drive performance characteristicsDisk storageExternal storageFormat warFlip-flop (electronics)Information AgeIOPSLibraryMagnetic tapeMedia (communication)Media controlsMedium format (film)MemristorNanodotNonlinear medium (random access)Plant-based digital data storageRecording formatSemiconductor memorySoftware-defined storageTelecommunicationVolatile memoryVisual artsReferences[edit]^ a b Gilbert, Walter (Feb 1986).
