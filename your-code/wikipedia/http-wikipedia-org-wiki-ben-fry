His doctoral dissertation, "Computational Information Design" introduces the seven stages of visualizing data: acquiring, parsing, filtering, mining, representing, refining and interacting.[3]  Career[edit] During his time at MIT Media Lab, Fry co-developed Processing, an open-source programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the basics of computer programming in a visual context.[4][5] The Processing design environment developed together with Casey Reas won a Golden Nica from the Prix Ars Electronica in 2005.[4] During 2006–2007, Fry was the Nierenberg Chair of Design for the Carnegie Mellon School of Design. He is a principal of Fathom, a design and software consultancy in Boston, Massachusetts.[6][7] Fry's artwork has been featured in the Cooper-Hewitt Design Triennial (2003, 2006)[1] and the Whitney Biennial (2002), and at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (2001, 2008), Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria (2000, 2002, 2005) and in the films Minority Report and The Hulk.[citation needed][4][8][9] He is the winner of the 2011 National Design Award in category "Interaction Design."[7][10]  Books[edit] 2007: (with Casey Reas) Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists, MIT Press 2007: Visualizing Data, O'Reilly 2010: (with Casey Reas) Getting Started with Processing, O'Reilly 2015: (with Casey Reas and Lauren McCarthy) Getting Started with p5.js, O'Reilly See also[edit] Timeline of programming languages Processing programming language References[edit]   ^ a b "Inside design now: National Design Triennial", by Ellen Lupton, Cooper-Hewitt Museum, "Benjamin Fry"  ^ Fry, Benjamin Jotham (2004).
