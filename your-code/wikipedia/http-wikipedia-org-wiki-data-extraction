The import into the intermediate extracting system is thus usually followed by data transformation and possibly the addition of metadata prior to export to another stage in the data workflow.Usually, the term data extraction is applied when (experimental) data is first imported into a computer from primary sources, like measuring or recording devices. Today's electronic devices will usually present an electrical connector (e.g. USB) through which 'raw data' can be streamed into a personal computer.Contents1 Data sources2 Imposing structure3 See also4 ReferencesData sources[edit]Typical unstructured data sources include web pages, emails, documents, PDFs, scanned text, mainframe reports, spool files, classifieds, etc. which is further used for sales or marketing leads. Extracting data from these unstructured sources has grown into a considerable technical challenge where as historically data extraction has had to deal with changes in physical hardware formats, the majority of current data extraction deals with extracting data from these unstructured data sources, and from different software formats. This growing process of data extraction[1] from the web is referred to as "Web data extraction" or "Web scraping".Imposing structure[edit]The act of adding structure to unstructured data takes a number of formsUsing text pattern matching such as regular expressions to identify small or large-scale structure e.g. records in a report and their associated data from headers and footers;Using a table-based approach to identify common sections within a limited domain e.g. in emailed resumes, identifying skills, previous work experience, qualifications etc. using a standard set of commonly used headings (these would differ from language to language), e.g. Education might be found under Education/Qualification/Courses;Using text analytics to attempt to understand the text and link it to other informationSee also[edit]Information extractionData retrievalExtract, transform, load (ETL)Data miningReferences[edit]^ data extraction.vteData warehousesCreating a data warehouseConceptsDatabaseDimensionDimensional modelingFactOLAPStar schemaSnowflake schemaReverse star schemaAggregateVariantsAnchor modelingColumn-oriented DBMSData vault modelingHOLAPMOLAPROLAPOperational data storeElementsData dictionary/MetadataData martSixth normal formSurrogate keyFactFact tableEarly-arriving factMeasureDimensionDimension tableDegenerateSlowly changingFillingExtract-Transform-Load (ETL)Extract-Load-Transform (ELT)ExtractTransformLoadUsing a data warehouseConceptsBusiness intelligenceDashboardData miningDecision support system (DSS)OLAP cubeData warehouse automationLanguagesData Mining Extensions (DMX)MultiDimensional eXpressions (MDX)XML for Analysis (XMLA)ToolsBusiness intelligence softwareReporting softwareSpreadsheetRelatedPeopleBill InmonRalph KimballProductsComparison of OLAP serversData warehousing products and their producersRetrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data_extraction&oldid=975799176"Categories: Data managementData warehousingHidden categories: Articles needing additional references from August 2020All articles needing additional referencesNavigation menuPersonal toolsNot logged inTalkContributionsCreate accountLog inNamespacesArticleTalkEnglishViewsReadEditView historyMoreSearchNavigationMain pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonateContributeHelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileToolsWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPage informationCite this pageWikidata itemPrint/exportDownload as PDFPrintable versionLanguagesالعربيةKiswahiliEdit links This page was last edited on 30 August 2020, at 13:46 (UTC).Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 3.0;additional terms may apply.
