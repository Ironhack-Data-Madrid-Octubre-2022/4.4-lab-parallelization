Semantic Scholar - Wikipedia Semantic ScholarFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia(Redirected from S2CID (identifier))Jump to navigationJump to searchSearch service for journal articlesSemantic ScholarType of siteSearch engineCreated byAllen Institute for Artificial IntelligenceURLsemanticscholar.orgLaunchedNovember 2015 (2015-11)Semantic Scholar is an artificial intelligence–powered research tool for scientific literature developed at the Allen Institute for AI and publicly released in November 2015.[1] It uses advances in natural language processing to provide summaries for scholarly papers.[2] The Semantic Scholar team is actively researching the use of artificial-intelligence in natural language processing, machine learning, Human-Computer interaction, and information retrieval.[3]Semantic Scholar began as a database surrounding the topics of computer science, geoscience, and neuroscience.[4] However, in 2017 the system began including biomedical literature in its corpus.[4] As of September 2022, they now include over 200 million publications from all fields of science.[5]Contents1 Technology2 Number of users and publications3 See also4 References5 External linksTechnology[edit]Semantic Scholar provides a one-sentence summary of scientific literature. One of its aims was to address the challenge of reading numerous titles and lengthy abstracts on mobile devices.[6] It also seeks to ensure that the three million scientific papers published yearly reach readers, since it is estimated that only half of this literature are ever read.[7]Artificial intelligence is used to capture the essence of a paper, generating it through an "abstractive" technique.[2] The project uses a combination of machine learning, natural language processing, and machine vision to add a layer of semantic analysis to the traditional methods of citation analysis, and to extract relevant figures, tables, entities, and venues from papers.[8][9]In contrast with Google Scholar and PubMed, Semantic Scholar is designed to highlight the most important and influential elements of a paper.[10] The AI technology is designed to identify hidden connections and links between research topics.[11] Like the previously cited search engines, Semantic Scholar also exploits graph structures, which include the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph, Springer Nature's SciGraph, and the Semantic Scholar Corpus.[12]Each paper hosted by Semantic Scholar is assigned a unique identifier called the Semantic Scholar Corpus ID (abbreviated S2CID). The following entry is an example:Liu, Ying; Gayle, Albert A; Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Rocklöv, Joacim (March 2020). "The reproductive number of COVID-19 is higher compared to SARS coronavirus". Journal of Travel Medicine. 27 (2). doi:10.1093/jtm/taaa021. PMID 32052846. S2CID 211099356.Semantic Scholar is free to use and unlike similar search engines (i.e. Google Scholar) does not search for material that is behind a paywall.[13][4]One study compared the search abilities of Semantic Scholar through a systematic approach, and found the search engine to be 98.88% accurate when attempting to uncover the data.[13] The same study examined other Semantic Scholar functions, including tools to survey metadata as well as several citation tools.[13]Number of users and publications[edit]As of January 2018, following a 2017 project that added biomedical papers and topic summaries, the Semantic Scholar corpus included more than 40 million papers from computer science and biomedicine.[14] In March 2018, Doug Raymond, who developed machine learning initiatives for the Amazon Alexa platform, was hired to lead the Semantic Scholar project.[15] As of August 2019, the number of included papers metadata (not the actual PDFs) had grown to more than 173 million[16] after the addition of the Microsoft Academic Graph records.[17] In 2020, a partnership between Semantic Scholar and the University of Chicago Press Journals made all articles published under the University of Chicago Press available in the Semantic Scholar corpus.[18] At the end of 2020, Semantic Scholar had indexed 190 million papers.[19]In 2020, users of Semantic Scholar reached seven million a month.[6]See also[edit]Citation analysis – Examination of the frequency, patterns, and graphs of citations in documentsCitation index – Index of citations between publicationsKnowledge extraction – Creation of knowledge from structured and unstructured sourcesList of academic databases and search enginesScientometrics – Study of measuring and analysing science, technology and innovationReferences[edit]^ Eunjung Cha, Ariana (3 November 2015).
