(Discuss) Proposed since April 2022. Data Repository and an Archive RepositoryA data library, data archive, or data repository is a collection of numeric and/or geospatial data sets for secondary use in research. A data library is normally part of a larger institution (academic, corporate, scientific, medical, governmental, etc.). established for research data archiving and to serve the data users of that organisation. The data library tends to house local data collections and provides access to them through various means (CD-/DVD-ROMs or central server for download).  A data library may also maintain subscriptions to licensed data resources for its users to access the information. Whether a data library is also considered a data archive may depend on the extent of unique holdings in the collection, whether long-term preservation services are offered, and whether it serves a broader community (as national data archives do). Most public data libraries are listed in the Registry of Research Data Repositories.Contents1 Importance and services2 Examples2.1 Natural sciences2.2 Multidisciplinary2.3 Social sciences3 See also4 Cited references5 Further reading6 External links6.1 AssociationsImportance and services[edit]In August 2001, the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) published a report[1] presenting results from a survey of ARL member institutions involved in collecting and providing services for numeric data resources.Library service providing support at the institutional level for the use of numerical and other types of  datasets in research. Amongst the support activities typically available:Reference Assistance — locating numeric or geospatial datasets containing measurable variables on a particular topic or group of topics, in response to a user query.User Instruction — providing hands-on training to groups of users in locating data resources on particular topics, how to download data and read it into spreadsheet, statistical, database, or GIS packages, how to interpret codebooks and other documentation.Technical Assistance - including easing registration procedures, troubleshooting problems with the dataset, such as errors in the documentation, reformatting data into something a user can work with, and helping with statistical methodology.Collection Development & Management - acquire, maintain, and manage a collection of data files used for secondary analysis by the local user community; purchase institutional data subscriptions; act as a site representative to data providers and national data archives for the institution.Preservation and Data Sharing Services - act on a strategy of preservation of datasets in the collection, such as media refreshment and file format migration; download and keep records on updated versions from a central repository. Also, assist users in preparing original data for secondary use by others; either for deposit in a central or institutional repository, or for less formal ways of sharing data. This may also involve marking up the data into an appropriate XML standard, such as the Data Documentation Initiative, or adding other metadata to facilitate online discovery.Examples[edit]Natural sciences[edit]The following list refers to scientific data archives.CISL Research Data ArchiveDataONEDryadESO/ST-ECF Science Archive FacilityInternational Tree-Ring Data BankInter-university Consortium for Political and Social ResearchKnowledge Network for BiocomplexityNational Archive of Computerized Data on AgingNational Archive of Criminal Justice Data [1]NCAR Research Data Archive:  http://rda.ucar.eduNational Climatic Data CenterNational Geophysical Data CenterNational Snow and Ice Data CenterNational Oceanographic Data CenterOak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive CenterPangaea - Data Publisher for Earth & Environmental ScienceNASA SeaBASS - Data archive for ocean color dataWorld Data CenterMultidisciplinary[edit]The following list refers to platforms made from multiple sources and domain agnosticWork With DataSocial sciences[edit]In the social sciences, data libraries are referred to as data archives.[2] Data archives are professional institutions for the acquisition, preparation, preservation, and dissemination of social and behavioral data. Data archives in the social sciences evolved in the 1950s and have been perceived as an international movement:By 1964 the International Social Science Council (ISSC) had sponsored a second conference on Social Science Data Archives and had a standing Committee on Social Science Data, both of which stimulated the data archives movement. By the beginning of the twenty-first century, most developed countries and some developing countries had organized formal and well-functioning national data archives. In addition, college and university campuses often have `data libraries' that make data available to their faculty, staff, and students; most of these bear minimal archival responsibility, relying for that function on a national institution (Rockwell, 2001, p. 3227).[3]re3data.org is a global registry of research data repository indexing data archives from all disciplines: http://www.re3data.orgCESSDA Members are data archives and other organisations that archive social science data and provide data for secondary use: https://www.cessda.eu/About/ConsortiumConsortium of European Social Science Data Archives: http://www.cessda.org/Finnish Social Science Data Archive (FSD): http://www.fsd.uta.fi/The Danish Data Archives: http://www.sa.dk/content/us/about_us Archived 2014-12-29 at the Wayback Machine ; specific page (only in Danish): https://web.archive.org/web/20150318230743/http://www.sa.dk/dda/default.htmInter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research: http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/The Roper Center for Public Opinion Research: https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/The Social Science Data Archive: http://dataarchives.ss.ucla.edu/Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research: https://ciser.cornell.edu/data/data-archive/See also[edit]Data bankData centerData curationDigital curationDigital preservationOpen DataCited references[edit]^ SPEC Kit 263: Numeric Data Products and Services^ White,Howard D.
